# NetflixKodi-expired
 This program allows to increase the expiration time or the renewal of the NFAuthenticationKey.key

# Disclaimer
This is a program that allows you to bypass the time limit of the NFAuthentication.key file of this kodi extension https://github.com/CastagnaIT/plugin.video.netflix.

# How to use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trolldu47/NetflixKodi-expired.git
cd NetflixKodi-expired
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
